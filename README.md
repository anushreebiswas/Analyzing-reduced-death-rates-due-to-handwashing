## Overview

In the 1840s, **childbed fever** was a major cause of death among women giving birth at the **Vienna General Hospital**. Hungarian physician **Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis** made a groundbreaking discovery: physicians’ unwashed hands were spreading infections. On **June 1st, 1847**, he introduced **mandatory handwashing**, which led to a dramatic reduction in maternal mortality.

This project re-analyzes the original hospital data to quantify the impact of handwashing using statistical analysis and visualization techniques in Python.

## Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Python** – Main programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and aggregation  
- **Matplotlib** – Time-series visualization  
- **Bootstrap Simulation** – Custom loop to compute a 95% confidence interval for mean difference

---

## Project Goals

- **Track Annual Mortality Trends** – Identify the year with the highest proportion of deaths at each clinic.
- **Evaluate Handwashing Impact** – Compare the average monthly death proportions before and after handwashing was introduced.
- **Bootstrap Analysis** – Estimate a 95% confidence interval of the difference in means using bootstrap sampling.
- **Data Visualization** – Plot death trends over time, split by clinic and handwashing status.

## Business Impact

1. **Clinical Validation**: Quantifies the impact of handwashing on mortality using real hospital data.

2. **Statistical Rigor**: Uses bootstrapped confidence intervals to provide robust statistical support for public health conclusions.

3. **Policy Influence**: Demonstrates how simple, cost-effective interventions (e.g., hand hygiene) can save lives.

4. **Healthcare Awareness**: Reinforces the critical importance of infection control in medical settings.
