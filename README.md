Python Statistical Data Analysis

##### Hungarian physician Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital with childbed fever patients. Childbed fever is a deadly disease affecting women who have just given birth, and in the early 1840s, as many as 10% of the women giving birth died from it at the Vienna General Hospital. Dr.Semmelweis discovered that it was the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies, and on June 1st, 1847, he decreed that everyone should wash their hands, an unorthodox and controversial request; nobody in Vienna knew about bacteria.We will reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing and its impact on the hospital and the number of deaths.

##### 1. How much did handwashing reduce monthly death rates on average?

##### 2. What year had the highest yearly proportion of deaths at each clinic? 

##### 3. Handwashing was introduced on June 1st, 1847. What are the mean proportions of deaths before and after handwashing from the monthly data? 

##### 4. Analyzing the difference in the mean monthly proportion of deaths before and after the introduction of handwashing using all of the data and calculating a 95% confidence interval.
