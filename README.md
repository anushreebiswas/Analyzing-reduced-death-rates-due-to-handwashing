Python Statistical Data Analysis

##### Hungarian physician Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis worked at the Vienna General Hospital with childbed fever patients. Childbed fever is a deadly disease affecting women who have just given birth, and in the early 1840s, as many as 10% of the women giving birth died from it at the Vienna General Hospital. Dr.Semmelweis discovered that it was the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies, and on June 1st, 1847, he decreed that everyone should wash their hands, an unorthodox and controversial request; nobody in Vienna knew about bacteria.We will reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of handwashing and its impact on the hospital and the number of deaths.

##### 1. How much did handwashing reduce monthly death rates on average?

##### 2. What year had the highest yearly proportion of deaths at each clinic? 

##### 3. Handwashing was introduced on June 1st, 1847. What are the mean proportions of deaths before and after handwashing from the monthly data? 

##### 4. Analyzing the difference in the mean monthly proportion of deaths before and after the introduction of handwashing using all of the data and calculating a 95% confidence interval.

## Overview

In the 1840s, **childbed fever** claimed the lives of up to 10% of new mothers at the **Vienna General Hospital**. Hungarian physician **Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis** made a groundbreaking observation: **physicians who did not wash their hands** were spreading infections from autopsies to maternity wards.

On **June 1st, 1847**, Dr. Semmelweis mandated **mandatory handwashing**, a move that drastically reduced mortality despite being controversial at the time. In this project, we reanalyze the original hospital data to understand the statistical impact of this change.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python** – For data analysis  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For visualizations  
- **Scipy.stats / Statsmodels** – For hypothesis testing and confidence intervals  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For documentation and interactive exploration

## Project Goals

- **Quantify Impact** – Calculate the average reduction in monthly death rates due to handwashing  
- **Compare Clinics** – Identify the year with the highest yearly death proportion per clinic  
- **Statistical Comparison** – Determine mean death proportions before and after June 1st, 1847  
- **Confidence Intervals** – Analyze whether the observed difference is statistically significant with a 95% confidence interval

## Business Impact

1. **Historical Validation**: Confirms the importance of hand hygiene using quantitative methods from original hospital data.

2. **Policy Influence**: Provides compelling evidence that can be used in healthcare policy-making around infection control.

3. **Public Health Advocacy**: Reinforces the need for preventive practices like handwashing to reduce healthcare-associated infections (HAIs).

4. **Educational Tool**: Acts as a powerful data-driven case study on the impact of simple interventions in clinical settings.
